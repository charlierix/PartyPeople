All types need to be able to jump onto a tier1 platform, but not onto a tier2 or over a wall


------------------------------- Warrior
Make this a quadruped.  Not thin like a horse, but stockier.  Have the hind legs shorter, like a hyena or giraffe

Taller than standard

Give this a strong forward charge, short bursts of speed in a forward direction

Standard jump height, a bit extra forward distance.  Almost no back jump, a small amount of side jump

Heavy weapons, armor, shields

Weapons:
    Various large heavy melee
    Javelin (somewhere between a javelin and a pike)
        When in melee, it's held like a sword.  Lots stab, not much other damage
        When in ranged, it reverses in the hand.  When thrown, the wrist must be pointed backward (can also stab while held in this position)
    Ball and chain
        Has longer reach (let it be extended/retracted)
    

Specials:
    Knock back



------------------------------- Hunter
Standard size, standard mobility

Jump a little higher normal (but still not high enough to reach a tier2 ledge)
    Bullet time is longer when at the top of a jump

Weaker melee weapons, Excellent ranged weapons:
    Bow & Arrow
        Long range, good aim, good damage
    Hatchet
        Medium all around
    Small sword



------------------------------- Shadow
Slightly shorter, high mobility

Can double/triple/quad jump
    Don't let the height keep growing, but do allow for lots of direction changing mid air
    Backflip + bullet time

Fun tricky weapons

Limited stealth?




------------------------------- Mage
Average height, mobility

Jumps are floaty.  Somewhere between an uncontrolled parabola and a jetpack

Average melee or ranged
    Pain stick
        Sort of a light saber, does a bunch of elemental damage.  Some chain lightning/stun effects
    Wands
    Blast ball
        Held in hand, so very short melee weapon.  Powerful aoe effects

Specials:
    Confusion
    Shield




------------------------------- Artificer
Shorter, slower, small bursts of speed

Uses a jetpack.  May want to require both hands pointed down to steer.  So very mobile while airborn to compensate for slower ground speed

Specials:
    Build things





------------------------------- Elemental Spirit
Tiny

Doesn't really walk, maybe hover just above the ground

Doesn't use direct weapons/armor.  All attached items are modifiers.  All damage is done with direct contact

Arms out like treading water
Arms down like a missle
Steering is relationship between head, hand position, wrist orientation

Enemies need to have auras that show where they take damage and where they give out damage

Trigger button probably needs to coincide with contact to do the damage.  Otherwise, you do minimal damage, can still take damge regardless of trigger

Can pass into walls a little, but get pushed out.  Maybe start taking damage if inside floors/walls too long

Mess with sound when blasting into them



------------------------------- Mind Controller
Small, very weak

Movement and jump based on messiah's cherub

Good stealth ability

Can possess enemies.  While possessing, it builds up damage that will be applied when you jump out of them
So while possessing, you are attacking other enemies, then when you jump out

Can only possess by jumping into their back

(things like spider nests would be difficult to implement)




------------------------------- Puppet Master
Dual.  The player has god hands, and the puppet is a small golem

The puppet will auto fire when close to enemies, can be melee or ranged

Jumping is also performed automatically

This is sort of like playing the mobile game in vr, but the player can directly affect the game

Any direct manipulations would use up mana, so the golem is needed for doing most of the damage

When applying a weather effect, hold both hands around an area, creating a circle, sort of like a target reticle

God hand specials:
    Create fog
    Drop meteors
    Drop down a wall
    Decoys -- clip your finger with the ground, and that will be a decoy
    Pinch enemy -- this will stun an enemy
    Enhance golem -- keep the hands close to the golem.  It acts like a conduit transferring your energy into the real world (visual effect flows from hands to golem)
        Heal golem
        Damage field -- the golem has an aura that damages enemies
        Fluid suspension -- nearby enemies are sluggish, somewhat floating
        Grow -- the golem grows around 50% does extra damage, takes less damage, moves faster (looks enraged)




****************************************************

All of the shared weapons have a socket.  Each player type has their own types of gems that can go in those sockets
The effects have a % chance

    Warrior:
        Drain defense
        Weaken
        Life Steal

    Hunter:
        Poison
        Fear
        Explosive

    Shadow
        Extra damage
        Blind
Explosive

    Mage
        Cold
        Flame
        Electric

    Artificer
        Stupidity/Disoriented (not a full on confuse, makes them forgetful, sometimes attack others)
        Gaseous/Stink (makes others increase distance from them)



Scythe?

Magical Escrima
    When dual yielded and the endpoints are somewhat lined up, draw an electric bezier curve between those points
    The other end caps would leak out electricity
    So they do direct blunt damage, but can also do indirect magic damage
